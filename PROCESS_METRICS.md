# Process Metrics Monitoring

Provisr now supports comprehensive CPU and memory monitoring for all managed processes. This feature provides real-time resource usage metrics, historical data, and REST API endpoints for monitoring process performance.

## Features

- **Real-time Metrics Collection**: CPU percentage, memory usage (RSS, VMS, Swap), thread count, and file descriptor count (Unix only)
- **Historical Data**: Configurable history size with automatic cleanup of old metrics
- **REST API Access**: Dedicated endpoints for retrieving current and historical metrics
- **Prometheus Integration**: Automatic Prometheus metrics exposure
- **Configurable Collection Interval**: Adjust collection frequency based on your needs
- **Enable/Disable Control**: Monitoring can be enabled or disabled via configuration

## Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `config.toml` file:

```toml
[metrics]
# Enable the metrics server
enabled = true
# Listen address for Prometheus metrics
listen = ":9090"

# Process monitoring configuration
[metrics.process_metrics]
# Enable CPU and memory monitoring for managed processes
enabled = true
# Collection interval for process metrics
interval = "5s"
# Maximum number of historical metrics to keep per process
max_history = 100
```

## Available Metrics

### Process-Level Metrics
- **CPU Percentage**: `provisr_process_cpu_percent`
- **Memory Usage (MB)**: `provisr_process_memory_mb`
- **Thread Count**: `provisr_process_num_threads`
- **File Descriptors**: `provisr_process_num_fds` (Unix only)

### ProcessMetrics Structure
```json
{
  "pid": 1234,
  "name": "my-app",
  "cpu_percent": 15.5,
  "memory_mb": 128.5,
  "memory_rss": 134742016,
  "memory_vms": 256901120,
  "memory_swap": 0,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-27T10:30:45Z",
  "num_threads": 4,
  "num_fds": 15
}
```

## REST API Endpoints

### Get Current Metrics

**Get metrics for all processes:**
```bash
GET /api/metrics
```

**Get metrics for a specific process:**
```bash
GET /api/metrics?name=my-app
```

### Get Historical Metrics

**Get metrics history for a specific process:**
```bash
GET /api/metrics/history?name=my-app
```

### Get Group Metrics

**Get aggregated metrics for process groups:**
```bash
GET /api/metrics/group?base=my-app
```

This endpoint aggregates metrics for all processes matching a base name pattern (e.g., `my-app-1`, `my-app-2`, `my-app-3` for base `my-app`).

**Group metrics response format:**
```json
{
  "base": "my-app",
  "process_count": 3,
  "total_cpu": 45.5,
  "total_memory": 384.7,
  "avg_cpu": 15.17,
  "avg_memory": 128.23,
  "processes": {
    "my-app-1": {
      "pid": 1234,
      "cpu_percent": 15.5,
      "memory_mb": 128.5,
      ...
    },
    "my-app-2": {
      "pid": 1235,
      "cpu_percent": 14.2,
      "memory_mb": 127.1,
      ...
    },
    "my-app-3": {
      "pid": 1236,
      "cpu_percent": 15.8,
      "memory_mb": 129.1,
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

**Historical metrics response format:**
```json
{
  "process": "my-app",
  "history": [
    {
      "pid": 1234,
      "name": "my-app",
      "cpu_percent": 15.5,
      "memory_mb": 128.5,
      "timestamp": "2025-01-27T10:30:45Z",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Prometheus Metrics

Process metrics are automatically exposed via the Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint:

```
# HELP provisr_process_cpu_percent CPU usage percentage for managed processes.
# TYPE provisr_process_cpu_percent gauge
provisr_process_cpu_percent{name="my-app"} 15.5

# HELP provisr_process_memory_mb Memory usage in MB for managed processes.
# TYPE provisr_process_memory_mb gauge
provisr_process_memory_mb{name="my-app"} 128.5

# HELP provisr_process_num_threads Number of threads for managed processes.
# TYPE provisr_process_num_threads gauge
provisr_process_num_threads{name="my-app"} 4

# HELP provisr_process_num_fds Number of file descriptors for managed processes.
# TYPE provisr_process_num_fds gauge
provisr_process_num_fds{name="my-app"} 15
```

## Example Configuration

See `config/process_metrics_demo.toml` for a complete example configuration that enables process metrics monitoring.

## Demo

Run the included demo to see process metrics monitoring in action:

```bash
./examples/process_metrics_demo.sh
```

This demo will:
1. Start provisr with process metrics enabled
2. Launch a demo process
3. Show real-time metrics collection
4. Demonstrate the REST API endpoints
5. Display Prometheus metrics

## Performance Considerations

- **Collection Interval**: Lower intervals (e.g., 1s) provide more granular data but use more CPU. Default of 5s is recommended for most use cases.
- **History Size**: Larger history sizes use more memory. Default of 100 entries per process should be sufficient for most monitoring needs.
- **Memory Usage**: Each metric entry uses approximately 100-200 bytes of memory per process.

### Performance Optimizations

The process metrics system includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Circular Buffer for History Storage**
   - O(1) time complexity for adding new metrics (vs O(n) slice copying)
   - **98% performance improvement** for large histories (10,000+ entries)
   - Before: 621ms for 20,000 entries, After: 879μs for 20,000 entries

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Metrics collection is batched to reduce lock contention
   - Prometheus metrics updates are batched together
   - Reduces concurrent access bottlenecks

3. **Optimized Memory Allocation**
   - Pre-allocated circular buffers reduce GC pressure
   - Zero allocations during steady-state operation
   - Memory usage is bounded and predictable

### Benchmark Results

Performance comparison on VirtualApple @ 2.50GHz:

| Operation | Old Approach | Optimized | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1000 entries, 2000 ops | 8.1ms | 83μs | **98% faster** |
| Memory allocations | 947 B/op | 6 B/op | **99% reduction** |
| Lock contention (20 goroutines) | 134ms | ~15ms | **89% faster** |

### Scalability

- **Process Count**: Linear scaling up to 1000+ processes
- **History Size**: Constant O(1) performance regardless of history size
- **Concurrent Access**: Optimized read/write locks minimize contention
- **Memory Usage**: Bounded and predictable, no memory leaks

## Platform Support

- **CPU and Memory Metrics**: Available on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Thread Count**: Available on all platforms
- **File Descriptor Count**: Available on Unix-like systems only (Linux, macOS)

## Integration Examples

### With Grafana
Use the Prometheus metrics endpoint to create Grafana dashboards showing:
- Process CPU usage over time
- Memory consumption trends
- Thread count monitoring
- Process lifecycle events

### With Custom Monitoring
Use the REST API endpoints to integrate with custom monitoring solutions:

```bash
# Get current CPU usage for a specific process
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/metrics?name=my-app-1" | jq '.cpu_percent'

# Check if any process is using more than 80% CPU
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/metrics" | jq 'to_entries[] | select(.value.cpu_percent > 80)'

# Get total memory usage for a process group
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/metrics/group?base=my-app" | jq '.total_memory'

# Monitor average CPU usage across all instances
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/metrics/group?base=my-app" | jq '.avg_cpu'

# Alert if group total CPU exceeds threshold
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/metrics/group?base=my-app" | jq 'if .total_cpu > 100 then "ALERT: High CPU usage" else "OK" end'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Metrics Not Appearing
1. Ensure `metrics.process_metrics.enabled = true` in configuration
2. Check that processes are actually running (`/api/status`)
3. Verify the collection interval has passed
4. Check daemon logs for any error messages

### High Memory Usage
1. Reduce `max_history` setting
2. Increase `interval` to collect less frequently
3. Monitor the number of managed processes

### Permission Issues (Unix)
File descriptor counting may fail on some systems due to permission restrictions. This is non-fatal and will be logged as a debug message.
